BUNGA - The Kidnapped Puddy Cat
===============================

This project was an old DOS based side scrolling game I was working on in
the late 90's. I was trying to figure out how to do a nice mapping system
and scrolling layered backgrounds. I even finished the little character
to walk with animated scenes, but never finished the jumping function with
gravity to make him fall back down, nor did I finish the pixel hit detection
to make him fall in the water or to let him shoot.
